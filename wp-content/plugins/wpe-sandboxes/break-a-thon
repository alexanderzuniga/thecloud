<h4>Helloooo Break-A-Thon-ers!</h4>
<p>The first 4 breaks are examples, as described in
    <a href="https://supportwiki.wpengine.com/w/break-a-thon-how-to/" target="_BLANK">the SupportWiki article</a>.
    Number 5 is all you!<br/>
    Of course feel free to make more than one!  Just de-then-re-activate the plugin to see your new file(s).

<p>Everything should be explained in
    <a href="https://supportwiki.wpengine.com/w/break-a-thon-how-to/" target="_BLANK">the SupportWiki article</a>,<br/>
    but feel free to reach out to the HipChat room ('Break-A-Thon') or Natalie Rogers or DB.<br/>

    Have fun!!!
